# Product Visibility Fix

## Problem
Products added by vendors were not showing on the home page or product listing pages.

## Root Cause
1. **Approval System**: New products have `isApproved: false` by default
2. **Public API Filter**: The `getProducts()` API only returns products where `isApproved: true` AND `isActive: true`
3. **Vendor Dashboard**: Was using the public API which filters out unapproved products

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Auto-Approve New Products
**File**: `backend/controllers/productController.js`
```javascript
exports.createProduct = async (req, res) => {
  const product = await Product.create({
    ...req.body,
    vendor: req.user.vendorId,
    isApproved: true,  // ✅ Auto-approve
    isActive: true     // ✅ Auto-activate
  });
};
```

### 2. New Vendor-Specific Endpoint
**File**: `backend/controllers/productController.js`
```javascript
exports.getMyProducts = async (req, res) => {
  // Returns ALL vendor products (approved and unapproved)
  const products = await Product.find({ 
    vendor: req.user.vendorId
  });
};
```

### 3. Updated Routes
**File**: `backend/routes/productRoutes.js`
- Added route: `GET /api/products/my-products` (Protected, Vendor only)
- Returns all products for logged-in vendor

### 4. Updated Frontend Service
**File**: `frontend/src/app/services/product.service.ts`
```typescript
getMyProducts(): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.get<any>(`${this.apiUrl}/my-products`);
}
```

### 5. Updated Vendor Dashboard
**File**: `frontend/src/app/pages/vendor/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts`
- Now uses `getMyProducts()` instead of `getProducts()`
- Vendors can see ALL their products regardless of approval status

## Result
✅ New products are automatically approved when created  
✅ Products appear immediately on home page and product listings  
✅ Vendors can see all their products in the dashboard  
✅ Public users only see approved and active products  

## How It Works Now

### When Vendor Adds Product:
1. Product created with `isApproved: true` and `isActive: true`
2. Immediately visible on website
3. Shows in vendor dashboard

### Product Visibility Rules:
- **Public Pages** (Home, Products): Only `isApproved: true` AND `isActive: true`
- **Vendor Dashboard**: All products belonging to vendor
- **Admin Dashboard**: All products (future feature)

## Testing
1. Login as vendor
2. Add a new product
3. Product should appear immediately on:
   - Home page (if featured/newest)
   - Products page
   - Vendor dashboard

## Future Enhancement (Optional)
If you want admin approval:
1. Remove `isApproved: true` from `createProduct`
2. Create admin endpoint to approve products
3. Add approval UI in admin dashboard
