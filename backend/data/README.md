## üöÄ How to Import Products

### Step 1: Install Required Package
```bash
cd backend
npm install csv-parser
```

### Step 2: Ensure Categories Exist
Make sure you've run the categories seed script first:
```bash
node scripts/seedCategories.js
```

### Step 3: Import Products
```bash
node scripts/importProductsFromCSV.js
```

## ‚úÖ What the Script Does

1. **Connects to MongoDB** using your .env configuration
2. **Finds or creates a vendor** (default vendor for all products)
3. **Maps categories** from names to MongoDB IDs
4. **Clears existing products** (optional - you can comment this out)
5. **Reads CSV file** and parses product data
6. **Generates unique slugs** for each product (product-name-abc123)
7. **Adds random ratings** (3.0-5.0 stars) and reviews (10-210 reviews)
8. **Imports in batches** of 20 products for better performance
9. **Auto-approves products** so they appear immediately
10. **Shows summary** with success/error counts

## üìä Product Data Fields

Each product includes:
- ‚úÖ Name & Description
- ‚úÖ Price & Discount Price
- ‚úÖ Category (Electronics, Fashion, Books, Sports, Beauty, Home)
- ‚úÖ Brand
- ‚úÖ Stock quantity
- ‚úÖ High-quality images from Pexels
- ‚úÖ Relevant tags for search
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated unique slug
- ‚úÖ Random rating & reviews
- ‚úÖ Auto-approved & active status

## üñºÔ∏è Image Sources

All product images are from **Pexels.com** - free high-quality stock photos that you can use commercially without attribution.

## üîß Customization

### To Keep Existing Products
Comment out this line in `importProductsFromCSV.js`:
```javascript
// await Product.deleteMany({});
```

### To Add More Products
Simply add more rows to `products.csv` following the same format:
```csv
name,description,price,discountPrice,category,brand,stock,images,tags
"Product Name","Description here",9999,7999,Electronics,BrandName,50,"https://image-url.jpg","tag1,tag2,tag3"
```

## üìù Notes

- All prices are in Indian Rupees (‚Çπ)
- Images are direct URLs from Pexels CDN (fast & reliable)
- Products are automatically assigned to the first vendor account
- Slugs are auto-generated with random suffixes to ensure uniqueness
- Categories must match exactly: Electronics, Fashion, Books, Sports, Beauty, Home

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Error: "Category not found"**
- Run `node scripts/seedCategories.js` first

**Error: "csv-parser not found"**
- Run `npm install csv-parser`

**Error: "MONGODB_URI not defined"**
- Check your `.env` file has MONGODB_URI configured

**Error: "E11000 duplicate key slug"**
- The script now adds random suffixes, but if you still get this, delete existing products first

## üéâ Success!

After successful import, you should see:
```
[SUCCESS] Total products imported: 100
[SAMPLE PRODUCTS]
